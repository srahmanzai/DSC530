import nsfg
import first


# Given a list of values, there are several ways to count the frequency of each value.

# In[2]:


t = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]


# You can use a Python dictionary:

# In[3]:


hist = {}
for x in t:
    hist[x] = hist.get(x, 0) + 1
    
hist


# You can use a `Counter` (which is a dictionary with additional methods):

# In[4]:


from collections import Counter
counter = Counter(t)
counter


# Or you can use the `Hist` object provided by `thinkstats2`:

# In[5]:


import thinkstats2
hist = thinkstats2.Hist([1, 2, 2, 3, 5])
hist


# `Hist` provides `Freq`, which looks up the frequency of a value.

# In[6]:


hist.Freq(2)


# You can also use the bracket operator, which does the same thing.

# In[7]:


hist[2]


# If the value does not appear, it has frequency 0.

# In[8]:


hist[4]


# The `Values` method returns the values:

# In[9]:


hist.Values()


# So you can iterate the values and their frequencies like this:

# In[10]:


for val in sorted(hist.Values()):
    print(val, hist[val])


# Or you can use the `Items` method:

# In[11]:


for val, freq in hist.Items():
     print(val, freq)


# `thinkplot` is a wrapper for `matplotlib` that provides functions that work with the objects in `thinkstats2`.
# 
# For example `Hist` plots the values and their frequencies as a bar graph.
# 
# `Config` takes parameters that label the x and y axes, among other things.

# In[12]:


import thinkplot
thinkplot.Hist(hist)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='value', ylabel='frequency')


# As an example, I'll replicate some of the figures from the book.
# 
# First, I'll load the data from the pregnancy file and select the records for live births.

# In[13]:


preg = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
live = preg[preg.outcome == 1]


# Here's the histogram of birth weights in pounds.  Notice that `Hist` works with anything iterable, including a Pandas Series.  The `label` attribute appears in the legend when you plot the `Hist`. 

# In[14]:


hist = thinkstats2.Hist(live.birthwgt_lb, label='birthwgt_lb')
thinkplot.Hist(hist)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Birth weight (pounds)', ylabel='Count')


# Before plotting the ages, I'll apply `floor` to round down:

# In[20]:


ages = np.floor(live.agepreg)


# In[21]:


hist = thinkstats2.Hist(ages, label='agepreg')
thinkplot.Hist(hist)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='years', ylabel='Count')


# As an exercise, plot the histogram of pregnancy lengths (column `prglngth`).

# In[23]:


hist = thinkstats2.Hist(live.prglngth, label='prglngth')
thinkplot.Hist(hist)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Pregnancy Length', ylabel='Count')


# `Hist` provides smallest, which select the lowest values and their frequencies.

# In[24]:


for weeks, freq in hist.Smallest(10):
    print(weeks, freq)


# Use `Largest` to display the longest pregnancy lengths.

# In[26]:


for weeks, freq in hist.Largest(10):
    print(weeks, freq)


# From live births, we can select first babies and others using `birthord`, then compute histograms of pregnancy length for the two groups.

# In[56]:


firsts = live[live.birthord == 1]
others = live[live.birthord != 1]

first_hist = thinkstats2.Hist(firsts.prglngth, label='first')
other_hist = thinkstats2.Hist(others.prglngth, label='other')


# We can use `width` and `align` to plot two histograms side-by-side.

# In[31]:


width = 0.45
thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.Hist(first_hist, align='right', width=width)
thinkplot.Hist(other_hist, align='left', width=width)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='weeks', ylabel='Count', xlim=[27, 46])


# `Series` provides methods to compute summary statistics:

# In[32]:


mean = live.prglngth.mean()
var = live.prglngth.var()
std = live.prglngth.std()


# Here are the mean and standard deviation:

# In[33]:


mean, std


# As an exercise, confirm that `std` is the square root of `var`:

# In[36]:


import math
math.sqrt(var)
#As seen above, I used the math function to perform a square root on the variance already calculated.  
#It came to the same value as the standard deviation of 2.702 which confirms that std is the
#square root of variance.


# Here's are the mean pregnancy lengths for first babies and others:

# In[37]:


firsts.prglngth.mean(), others.prglngth.mean()


# And here's the difference (in weeks):

# In[38]:


firsts.prglngth.mean() - others.prglngth.mean()


# This functon computes the Cohen effect size, which is the difference in means expressed in number of standard deviations:

# In[41]:


def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    """Computes Cohen's effect size for two groups.

    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()

    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)

    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)

    return d

# Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.
